IMPORTANT!!! Do not reboot the pi until you've configured the node. Otherwise, it will not bring up any of it's interfaces, and you'll need console mode to bring up an IP.%0a%3c %0a%3c If this node will be connected to your router, in order to supply internet access to the mesh, leave it as a WAN device. If you will have clients connected (Via it's eth interface) configure it as a "LAN" node. The pi has a neat feature where the ethernet connection doesn't require a crossover cable, it will autonegotiate the connection even with a straight cable. So, connect it to your laptop %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
