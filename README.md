website
=======

This is all the code making up the website, excluding auth files.

You will need to re-add passwords in local/.htpasswd, along with users.  And, files that can be downloaded from elsewhere aren't included either (Image files to flash, no need).  Otherwise, all content created by Buffalomesh.net is present to enable re-creation of the site.
